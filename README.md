After reverse engineering the village cinemas WebTicketing API, I made 
this python script that retrieves a list of currently playing movies 
and the ticket availability and showtimes. It then fetches additional 
information such as the plot and rating from IMDb, sorts them according
to rating and presents them in an appealing and user-friendly manner.
